    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"/> with DNS64 <xref target="RFC6147"/> is a widely-deployed mechanism to provide IPv4 access on IPv6-only networks. In various scenarios, the host must be aware of the NAT64 prefix in use by the network. This document specifies a Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"/> option to communicate the NAT64 prefix to hosts.</t>

    <section title="Use cases for communicating the NAT64 prefix to hosts">
        <t>On networks employing NAT64, it is useful for hosts to know the NAT64 prefix for several reasons, including the following:
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>Enabling DNS64 functions on end hosts. In particular:
			<list style="symbols">
            <t>Local DNSSEC validation (DNS64 in stub-resolver mode). As discussed in <xref target="RFC6147"/> section 2, the stub resolver in the host "will try to obtain (real) AAAA RRs, and in case they are not available, the DNS64 function will synthesize AAAA RRs for internal usage." This is required in order to use DNSSEC on a NAT64 network.</t>
	    <t>Trusted DNS server. AAAA synthesis is required for the host to be able to use a DNS server not provided by the network (e.g., a DNS-over-TLS server <xref target="RFC7858"/> with which the host has an existing trust relationship).</t>
	    <t>Networks with no DNS64 server. Hosts that support AAAA synthesis and that are aware of the NAT64 prefix in use do not need the network to perform the DNS64 function at all.</t>
    </list></t>
    <t> Enabling NAT64 address translation functions on end hosts. For example:
	    <list style="symbols">
            <t>IPv4 address literals on an IPv6-only host. As described in <xref target="RFC8305"/> section 7.1, IPv6-only hosts connecting to IPv4 address literals can translate the IPv4 literal to an IPv6 literal.</t>
            <t>464XLAT <xref target="RFC6877"/>. 464XLAT requires the host be aware of the NAT64 prefix.</t>
            </list>
    </t>
            </list>
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why include the NAT64 prefix in Router Advertisements">
	    <t>Fate sharing: NAT64 requires routing to be configured. IPv6 routing configuration requires receiving an IPv6 Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Therefore using Router Advertisements to provide hosts with NAT64 prefix ensures that NAT64 reachability information shares fate with the rest of network configuration on the host.</t> 
	    <t>Atomic configuration: including the NAT64 prefix in the Router Advertisement minimizes the number of packets required to configure a host. Only one packet (a Router Advertisement) is required to complete the network configuration. This speeds up the process of connecting to a network that supports NAT64/DNS64, and simplifies host implementation by removing the possibility that the host can have an incomplete layer 3 configuration (e.g., IPv6 addresses and prefixes, but no NAT64 prefix).</t>
      <t>Updatability: it is possible to change the NAT64 prefix at any time, because when it changes, it is possible to notify hosts by sending a new Router Advertisement.</t>
      <t>Deployability: all IPv6 hosts and networks are required to support Neighbor Discovery <xref target="RFC4861"/> so just a minor extension to the existing implementation is required. Other options such as <xref target="RFC7225"/> require implementing other protocols (e.g. PCP <xref target="RFC7225"/>) which could be considered an obstacle for deplyoment.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Usage Guidelines">
	    <t>To support prefix lengths defined in <xref target="RFC6052"/> this option contains the prefix length field. However as /96 prefix is considered to be the most common use case, the prefix length field is optional and only presents for non-/96 prefixes. It allows to keep the option length to a minimum (16 octets) for the most common case and increase it to 24 octets for non-/96 prefixes only (see <xref target="Format"/> below for more details).</t>
		    
	    <t>This option specifies exactly one NAT64 prefix for all IPv4 destinations. If the network operator desires to route different parts of the IPv4 address space to different NAT64 devices, this can be accomplished by routing more specifics of the NAT64 prefix to those devices. For example, if the operator would like to route 10.0.0.0/8 through NAT64 device A and the rest of the IPv4 space through NAT64 device B, and the operator's NAT64 prefix is 2001:db8:a:b::/96, then the operator can route 2001:db8:a:b::a00:0/104 to NAT64 A and 2001:db8:a:b::/64 to NAT64 B.</t>

            <t>This option may appear more than once in a Router Advertisement (e.g. in case of graceful renumbering the network from one NAT64 prefix to another). Host behaviour with regards to synthesizing IPv6 addresses from IPv4 addresses SHOULD follow the recommendations given in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7050"/>, limited to the NAT64 prefixes that have non-zero lifetime.</t>

	    <t>In a network (or a provisioning domain) that provides both IPv4 and NAT64, it may be desirable for certain IPv4 addresses not to be translated. An example might be private address ranges that are local to the network/provisioning domain and should not be reached through the NAT64. This type of configuration cannot be conveyed to hosts using this option, or through other NAT64 prefix provisioning mechanisms such as <xref target="RFC7050"/> or <xref target="RFC7225"/>. This problem does not apply in IPv6-only networks, because in such networks, the host does not have an IPv4 address and cannot reach any IPv4 destinations without the NAT64..</t>

	    <section anchor="mult_src" title="Handling Multiple NAT64 Prefixes"> 
		    <t>
			    In some cases a host may receive multiple NAT64 prefixes from different sources. Possible scenarios include (but are not limited to):
		    </t>
	    <t><list style="symbols">
			    <t> the host is using multiple mechanisms to discover PREF64 prefixes (e.g. by using PCP <xref target="RFC7225"/>) and/or by resolving IPv4-only fully qualified domain name <xref target="RFC7050"/> in addition to receiving the PREF64 RA option);</t>
			    <t> The pref64 option presents in a single RA more than once;</t>
			    <t> the host receives multiple RAs with different PREF64 prefixes on one or multiple interfaces.</t>
		    </list>
	    </t>
	    <t>When multiple PREF64 were discovered via RA PREF64 Option (the Option presents more than once in a single RA or multiple RAs were received), host behaviour with regards to synthesizing IPv6 addresses from IPv4 addresses SHOULD follow the recommendations given in Section 3 of <xref target="RFC7050"/>, limited to the NAT64 prefixes that have non-zero lifetime..</t>
    <t>
	    When different PREF64 are discovered by using multiple mechanisms, hosts SHOULD select one source of information only. The RECOMMENDED order is:
    <list style="symbols">
		    <t>PCP-discovered prefixes <xref target="RFC7225"/>, if supported;</t>
		    <t>PREF64 discovered via RA Option;</t>
		    <t>PREF64 resolving IPv4-only fully qualified domain name <xref target="RFC7050"/> </t>
	    </list>
    </t>
    <t>Note that if the network provides PREF64 both via this RA option and <xref target="RFC7225"/>, hosts that receive the PREF64 via RA option may choose to use it immediately before waiting for PCP to complete, and therefore some traffic may not reflect any more detailed configuration provided by PCP.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="cons" title="PREF64 Consistency"> 
	    <t>
	    Section 6.2.7 of <xref target="RFC4861"/> recommends that routers inspect RAs sent by other routers to ensure that all routers onlink advertise the consistent information. Routers SHOULD inspect valid PREF64 options received on a given link and verify the consistency. Detected inconsistencies indicate that one or more routers might be misconfigured. Routers SHOULD log such cases to system or network management.
Routers SHOULD check and compare the following information:
    <list style="symbols">
	    <t>set of PREF64 with non-zero lifetime;</t>
	    <t>set of PREF64 with zero lifetime.</t>
</list>

PvD-aware routers MUST only compare information scoped to the same implicit or explicit PvD.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Because Router Advertisements are required in all IPv6 configuration scenarios, on IPv6-only networks, Router Advertisements must already be secured, e.g., by deploying RA guard <xref target="RFC6105"/>. Providing all configuration in Router Advertisements increases security by ensuring that no other protocols can be abused by malicious attackers to provide hosts with invalid configuration.</t>
      <t>The security measures that must already be in place to ensure that Router Advertisements are only received from legitimate sources eliminate the problem of NAT64 prefix validation described in section 3.1 of <xref target="RFC7050"/>.</t>
